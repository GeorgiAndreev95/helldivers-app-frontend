# Helldivers 2 App – Frontend

An interactive web application inspired by Helldivers 2, built to serve as the frontend for a custom backend.
The app provides a hub where users can explore intel on enemy factions, units, weapons, and stratagems, while admins can securely add and manage entries.

This project combines modern frontend technologies with the satirical, militaristic tone of the Helldivers universe — because democracy won’t spread itself.
